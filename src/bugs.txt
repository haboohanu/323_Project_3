For "int" data types, you must decide the most appropriate Java data type depending on the reasonable largest value the field can store.
We have not met this requirement

You do need to use @NotNull or @Column(nullable = false) 
to indicate columns that cannot be null. 
(This is not necessary for primary keys, 
which can never be null.)

We need helper methods for bidirectional associations (more in instructions)
I wrote one helper method so creating a transcript adds itself to the student it's linked to
Not sure what other need them 

Check out Prerequisites.java line 26. I think there's an error there
but I want to see what you think
